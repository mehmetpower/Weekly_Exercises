inputs:
let currentYear;
let currentAge;
let desiredAge;

Process:
function retirement(currentAge, desiredAge){
  prompt currentAge
  while currentAge in the corner case{
    prompt currentAge
  }
  prompt desiredAge
  while desiredAge in the corner case{
    prompt desiredAge
  }
  let yearsLeft = desiredAge - currentAge
  let retirementYear = currentYear + yearsLeft

  if yearsLeft = 0
  return `you will retire at the year 'retirementYear' and you still have 'yearsLeft' year for retirement.
  else if yearsLeft = 0
  return `you will retire this year at the age of desiredAge.
  else
  return `you will retire at the year 'retirementYear' and you still have 'yearsLeft' years for retirement.
}

output:
let yearsLeft;
let retirementYear

Edge & Corner Cases:
1. currentAge and desiredAge:
  Nan
  negative number
  not integer
